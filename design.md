# Design Document

## Overview

The Factory Analytics and Dashboard Platform is a cloud-native, AI-powered analytics solution built on AWS that automatically discovers and analyzes factory database schemas to provide intelligent insights and dashboards. The system uses a microservices architecture with event-driven processing to handle schema inference, natural language query processing, and real-time dashboard generation while maintaining strict data privacy and security standards.
