# Design Document

## Overview

The Factory Analytics and Dashboard Platform is a cloud-native, AI-powered analytics solution designed to securely connect with any factory data sourceâ€”including ERP, MES, IoT, data warehouses, or other databases. The platform automatically infers database structures and relationships using AI, machine learning, and automated metadata analysis, even when schemas are incomplete, missing, or inconsistently named. Built on AWS with hybrid deployment support, the system provides dynamic, customizable dashboards, natural language querying, actionable AI-driven recommendations, multi-tenant security, and full privacy compliance. The architecture emphasizes extensibility, vendor-neutrality, and enterprise scalability across diverse manufacturing environments.

### Deployment Architecture

The system supports both cloud-native AWS deployment and hybrid environments. AWS deployment uses ECS Fargate with Application Load Balancer for high availability and auto-scaling. Each microservice runs in its own container with independent scaling policies. For hybrid deployments, core services can run on-premises while leveraging AWS AI/ML services through secure API connections. Multi-tenant isolation is achieved through separate database schemas and resource tagging, with tenant-specific scaling policies.
