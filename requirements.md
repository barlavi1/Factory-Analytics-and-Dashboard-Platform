# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Factory Analytics and Dashboard Platform is an AI-powered solution designed to securely connect with any factory data source—including ERP, MES, IoT, data warehouses, or other databases. The platform automatically infers database structures and relationships using AI, machine learning, and automated metadata analysis, even when schemas are incomplete, missing, or inconsistently named. Its core features include dynamic, customizable dashboards for production KPIs and business insights, powerful natural language querying, actionable AI-driven recommendations, multi-tenant security, and full privacy compliance. It supports cloud (AWS-native) or hybrid deployments, offers rich integration and extension points, and is architected for enterprise scalability and operation across diverse manufacturing environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

Secure Data Connectivity and Onboarding
User Story: As a factory operations manager, I want to securely connect to my factory's data sources (of any type, structure, or vendor) without the need for complete schema documentation, so I can quickly begin analyzing production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides database or data source credentials THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection using industry-standard encryption and authentication protocols.
2.WHEN the database schema is incomplete, missing, or inconsistent THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze tables, columns, types, and sample data to infer the full structure and relationships.
3.WHEN external schema or data definitions (Word, PDF, image, or text) are provided THEN the system SHALL parse and integrate this information to supplement or enhance inference.
4.IF the connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and actionable troubleshooting guidance.
5. The system SHALL support pluggable connectors to integrate new data source types in the future.

### Requirement 2

Automated Schema Discovery, Normalization, and Maintenance
User Story: As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically understand and keep up-to-date with my evolving database structure, so I can generate meaningful queries and dashboards without manual mapping-even as new tables or changes appear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.WHEN connecting to a data source THEN the system SHALL scan all accessible data, analyzing metadata, names, types, and representative samples.
2.WHEN inferring relationships THEN the system SHALL identify and score likely foreign keys, naming patterns, and data correlations using AI/ML.
3.WHEN names or schema are inconsistent THEN the system SHALL normalize field and table names and map similar concepts to standardized business terminology.
4. WHEN the schema evolves (new/removed tables, renamed fields) THEN the system SHALL update the metadata model and alert relevant users to changes.
5.WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive, explainable metadata model with confidence scores for each inferred relationship.
6. The system SHALL provide APIs/webhooks for third-party integration and validation of schema mappings.


### Requirement 3

Default and Customizable Dashboards
User Story: As a factory manager, I want to have immediate access to default dashboards for key production KPIs after connection, with the flexibility to customize them, so I can quickly assess and tailor factory performance insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.WHEN connection and schema analysis are complete THEN the system SHALL generate and display default dashboards showing production volume, efficiency, downtime, quality, and other core metrics.
2.WHEN displaying KPIs THEN the system SHALL use suitable visualizations (charts, gauges, tables) based on data type and analytical context.
3.WHEN KPI data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate missing/partial metrics and suggest alternative measurements.
4.WHEN editing dashboards THEN users SHALL be able to add, remove, or rearrange widgets, customize layouts, and save custom dashboard templates.
5. The system SHALL support real-time or near-real-time data updating for dashboards.

### Requirement 4

Natural Language Analytics and Storytelling
User Story: As a production supervisor, I want to ask questions in plain language and receive clear, visual, and actionable answers about my factory data, so I don’t need to learn complex query languages

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.WHEN a user enters a natural language query THEN the system SHALL parse the intent and translate it into accurate, explainable SQL.
2. WHEN creating queries THEN the system SHALL leverage the up-to-date schema model for high accuracy and safety.
3.WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate visualizations and assemble them into dashboards automatically.
4.WHEN presenting answers THEN the system SHALL include narrative explanations that describe insights, trends, risks, and potential implications, all in business-friendly language.
5. The system SHALL support multi-language interfaces and allow users to interact in their preferred language.


### Requirement 5

Actionable AI Recommendations, Alerts, and Automation
User Story: As a maintenance manager, I want to receive proactive, actionable recommendations, alerts, and suggested automations based on real-time and historical data, so I can address potential issues before they affect production.


#### Acceptance Criteria

1.WHEN analyzing production or maintenance data THEN the system SHALL detect patterns indicating upcoming equipment failures, efficiency declines, or quality anomalies.
2.WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL generate prioritized recommendations, with clear confidence levels and suggested actions.
3.WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL provide supporting data, the analysis methodology, and clear explanations to support user trust and auditability.
4. The system SHALL integrate with factory notification, ticketing, or maintenance scheduling systems for end-to-end automation or alerting.


### Requirement 6

Privacy, Security, and Compliance
User Story: As a compliance officer, I want to ensure that the analytics platform respects data privacy, only accesses authorized extracts, and maintains audit trails, to meet regulatory and enterprise requirements.


#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL only work with query results and never store raw factory data permanently (The system SHALL operate only on query-level, authorized extracts—raw production data is never exported or stored longer than permitted).
2. The system SHALL respect user permissions, data access controls, and deliver full tenant isolation when deployed for multiple factories or departments.
3. WHEN generating or exporting insights THEN audit trails SHALL record what data was accessed, by whom, and when.
4. The system SHALL provide data masking, anonymization, and granular privacy controls as required by enterprise or regulatory policy.
5. The system SHALL comply with applicable industry security and privacy standards.

### Requirement 7

Deployment, Scalability, and Resilience
User Story: As a system administrator, I want to deploy, scale, and operate the platform on AWS (or hybrid environments) with high availability, disaster recovery, and performance guarantees, so that it will reliably serve multiple factories even as data and user volumes grow

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system SHALL use AWS/Cloud services with auto-scaling and load balancing to manage varying workloads efficiently.
2. All data storage and transmission SHALL use strong encryption and meet modern security standards.
3. The platform SHALL support concurrent sessions, role-based access, and multi-user collaboration.
4.System resources SHALL auto-scale, and redundant deployment SHALL support high availability and disaster recovery.
