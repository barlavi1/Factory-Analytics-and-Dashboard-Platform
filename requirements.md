# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Factory Analytics and Dashboard Platform is an AI-powered system that connects securely to factory databases to provide intelligent analytics and insights. The platform automatically infers database structures and relationships using AI and metadata analysis, even when schemas are incomplete or missing. It generates dynamic dashboards with key production KPIs and allows users to interact through natural language queries, providing actionable insights with narrative explanations while maintaining strict privacy compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a factory operations manager, I want to securely connect to my factory's database without needing complete schema documentation, so that I can quickly start analyzing production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides database connection credentials THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection using industry-standard encryption protocols
2. WHEN the database schema is incomplete or missing THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze table structures, column types, and data patterns to infer relationships
3. WHEN schema documentation is available (Word, PDF, images, or text) THEN the system SHALL parse and incorporate this information to enhance the inferred schema
4. IF the connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to automatically understand my database structure and relationships, so that I can generate meaningful queries without manual schema mapping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system connects to a database THEN it SHALL scan all accessible tables and analyze column names, data types, and sample data
2. WHEN analyzing table relationships THEN the system SHALL identify foreign key relationships, naming patterns, and data correlations using AI algorithms
3. WHEN table or field names are inconsistent THEN the system SHALL normalize and map similar concepts to standard terminology
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive metadata model with confidence scores for each inferred relationship

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a factory manager, I want to see default dashboards with key production KPIs immediately after connecting, so that I can quickly assess factory performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically generate default dashboards showing production volume, efficiency metrics, downtime, and quality indicators
2. WHEN displaying KPIs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visualizations (charts, gauges, tables) based on data types and patterns
3. WHEN KPI data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate missing metrics and suggest alternative measurements
4. WHEN dashboards are generated THEN the system SHALL provide real-time or near-real-time data updates based on database capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a production supervisor, I want to ask questions in plain language about my factory data, so that I can get insights without learning complex query languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language query THEN the system SHALL parse the intent and convert it to optimized SQL queries
2. WHEN generating SQL queries THEN the system SHALL use the inferred schema and relationships to ensure accurate data retrieval
3. WHEN query results are returned THEN the system SHALL automatically create appropriate visualizations and dashboards
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL include narrative explanations describing what the data shows and potential implications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintenance manager, I want to receive actionable recommendations based on my factory data, so that I can proactively address potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing production data THEN the system SHALL identify patterns indicating potential equipment failures, efficiency drops, or quality issues
2. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL generate specific recommendations with priority levels and suggested actions
3. WHEN presenting insights THEN the system SHALL include confidence levels and supporting data for each recommendation
4. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of the analysis methodology and data sources used

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to ensure that the analytics platform maintains data privacy and only accesses authorized information, so that we meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL only work with query results and never store raw factory data permanently
2. WHEN accessing database information THEN the system SHALL respect user permissions and database access controls
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include audit trails showing what data was accessed and when
4. WHEN handling sensitive information THEN the system SHALL implement data masking and anonymization where required by policy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the platform on AWS with proper scalability and security, so that it can handle multiple factories and growing data volumes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL use AWS services with auto-scaling capabilities to handle variable workloads
2. WHEN storing system data THEN it SHALL use encrypted storage and secure data transmission protocols
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL support concurrent sessions with proper authentication and authorization
4. WHEN system load increases THEN it SHALL automatically scale compute and storage resources while maintaining performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to customize and save my dashboards and queries, so that I can quickly access the most relevant information for my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing dashboards THEN users SHALL be able to modify layouts, add/remove widgets, and adjust time ranges
2. WHEN creating custom queries THEN users SHALL be able to save them for future use with descriptive names
3. WHEN dashboards are customized THEN the system SHALL save user preferences and restore them on subsequent logins
4. WHEN sharing insights THEN users SHALL be able to export dashboards and reports in common formats (PDF, Excel, images)
