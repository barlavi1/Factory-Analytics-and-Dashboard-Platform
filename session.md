New Session





I want to build a factory analytics and dashboard platform that connects securely to a factory’s database—even when the database schema is missing or incomplete. The system should use AI and automated metadata analysis tools to infer the database structure and relationships, enabling it to generate optimized SQL queries dynamically, even if table and field names are inconsistent. If a schema and database relationships are available, they may be provided as documents (Word, PDF, images, or text).

Users receive default dashboards showing key production KPIs and can ask questions in plain language, such as “Show me all at-risk machines.” The system automatically produces relevant dashboards, visualizations, and actionable recommendations, presenting results as insights along with narrative explanations—all while ensuring privacy compliance by working only on authorized query results.

The project will be deployed on AWS. 

You should start by creating the project specs.

I'll help you create a spec for your factory analytics and dashboard platform. Based on your description, I'll call this feature "factory-analytics-platform" and start by creating the requirements document.

Canceled creation

requirements.md

I've created the initial requirements document for your Factory Analytics and Dashboard Platform. The requirements cover all the key aspects you mentioned:

Secure database connectivity with AI-powered schema inference
Support for incomplete schemas and various documentation formats
Automatic generation of production KPI dashboards
Natural language query processing
Actionable insights and recommendations
Privacy compliance and data security
AWS deployment with scalability
User customization capabilities
Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design.

Great! Now I'll create the design document. Let me first research some key aspects of this system to inform the design.

Looking for any existing patterns or approaches for database schema inference
Now I'll create a comprehensive design document based on the requirements and incorporating best practices for AWS-based analytics platforms:

Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan.

Perfect! Now I'll create the implementation plan with actionable coding tasks based on the requirements and design.

Do the tasks look good?

Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive spec for your Factory Analytics and Dashboard Platform. The spec includes:

Requirements Document - 8 detailed requirements covering secure database connections, AI-powered schema inference, natural language querying, dashboard generation, recommendations, privacy compliance, AWS deployment, and user customization.

Design Document - A complete system architecture with microservices design, data models, error handling strategies, testing approaches, and security considerations. The design leverages AWS services like ECS Fargate, SageMaker, Cognito, and various other managed services.

Implementation Plan - 13 major phases broken down into 39 specific coding tasks, each with clear objectives and requirement references. The plan follows a logical progression from infrastructure setup through core services, AI/ML components, frontend development, and final deployment.

The spec is now complete and ready for implementation. You can begin executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with task 1 (project structure and infrastructure) and working through them sequentially, as each task builds upon the previous ones.

The platform will provide a robust, AI-powered analytics solution that can intelligently connect to factory databases, infer schemas automatically, and provide actionable insights through natural language interfaces - all while maintaining strict privacy and security standards on AWS.
